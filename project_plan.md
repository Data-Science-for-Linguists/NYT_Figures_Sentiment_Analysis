#### DATA SOURCE  
> I will attempt to use the NY Times Annotated Text. After extracting the information I am going to use I can write
a script to find proper names of figures, and keep track of the number of times they are mentioned. This gives me a
starting point to decide what figures to perform a sentiment analysis on. Ideally, I would like to find figures that
are mentioned at least once over multiple years.

#### ANALYSIS  
> Using corpus tools to assist in processing the information in the corpus, I can gather which figures I could
potentially do a sentiment analysis on.After figures are collected, I can aggregate the vocabulary surrounding the
figure's name, and provide a lookup table where certain words are given a sentiment score. The score varies to the
degree of positiveness or negativeness. Modifier words like 'very' or 'really' would also play into the sentiment score.
Once sentiment scores are found for each figure, I can compare them against one another over time.

#### PRESENTATION
> For the presentation, I would prepare visual representations of the data collected for each figure.
