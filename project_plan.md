#### DATA SOURCE  
> I will download the data from the TIME archive from 2000-2017. After cleaning up the text, I can write a script to 
find proper names of figures, and keep track of the number of times they are mentioned. This gives me a starting point 
to decide what figures to perform a sentiment analysis on. Ideally, I would like to find figures that are mentioned at 
least once for each year in TIME. 

#### ANALYSIS  
> After figures are collected, I can aggregate the vocabulary surrounding the figure's name, and provide a lookup table
where certain words are given a sentiment score. The score varies to the degree of positiveness or negativeness. 
Modifier words like 'very' or 'really' would also play into the sentiment score. Once sentiment scores are found for 
each figure, I can compare them against one another over time.

#### PRESENTATION
> For the presentation, I would prepare visual representations of the data collected for each figure over time.
