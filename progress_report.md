## October 11-12
I started to small-scale process the xml files in my data. Because the corpus is already well annotated XML files, it was more of a matter of reading in the data that I need and storing the relevant information in a DataFrame so that I can work with only the information I need. The DataFrame is still a WIP and more information will be appended to it. I could also create multiple DataFrames with separate information. THey would be linked by their index?
