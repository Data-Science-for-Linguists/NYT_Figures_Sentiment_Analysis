### Description
This project explores the data contained in the New York Times Annotated Corpus
to answer questions related to sentiment. The code processes data from the years
2000-2007 and answers the following questions:
1. Who are the Top 10 mentioned people?
2. What topics are associated with positive articles? What topics are negative
articles?
3. What words are associated with positive articles? What words are associated
with negative words?
4. Are there particular months that harbor a particular sentiment?

### Data Set
The data set used is the [New York Times Annotated Corpus](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2008t19), licensed by the Linguistic
Data Consortium. The data is already annotated and tagged as XML files. The data
is organized into a file tree by year, month, then date.
