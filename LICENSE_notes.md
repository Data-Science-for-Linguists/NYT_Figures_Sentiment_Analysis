# Repository Licensing
As far as selecting a license for the repository, I chose to apply an MIT
License to my project repository to allow others to take a modify the code to be able to learn from or make improvements to. Additionally, the license simply requires credit back for the original code and prevents liability for what the code may cause. Because I'm not trying to gain money from this project, I don't mind making the code available to others should they find a use for it.

# Availability of Data
Under the User License Agreement for the NYT Annotated Corpus, the agreement states:

> "User shall not publish, retransmit, display, redistribute, reproduce, or commercially exploit the Data in any form, except that User may include limited excerpts from the Data in articles, reports, and other documents describing the results of User's linguistic education, research, and technology development."

Thus I am unsure of how to proceed in terms of providing "limited excerpts" of data. Does that mean I can include a single file for the public, but not the whole thing? Or am I only permitted to include a snippet of a file when discussing it in a written analysis? Should the direct source code be visible or should I include the snippets as JPEGs or other image types?

As of now, I am choosing to keep the data sample available to other members of our class group, since they would have the same permissions to view the data as I do, since they are members of the Univ. of Pittsburgh. Should I make the repository completely public facing however, I will likely take the XML file down and possibly provide JPEG images of only relevant parts of the data.
